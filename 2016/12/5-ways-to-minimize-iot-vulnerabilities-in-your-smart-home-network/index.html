<p>The <a href="/2016/10/19/why-no-open-source-iot-firmware/">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) is continuing to expand and broaden its own horizons while simultaneously helping to usher people into a
future, which is brimming with all the possibilities that an interconnected world presents. There are many industries that are working to
incorporate the Internet of Things into their infrastructure. One of these industries has been the home security industry and there are many
homeowners who are no proud parents to smart homes.</p>

<p>The smart home is one greatest aspects of the Internet of Things, just because of the sheer number of actions it allows you to complete through
simple commands. For instance, some people can program their homes so that their lights come on as soon as they walk through the door. There are
many benefits to the IoT, from increased efficiency to more comfortable living. However, there are some inherent vulnerabilities in the way the
Internet of Things works, and it is easy to see why.</p>

<p>The basis of the IoT is that there are several different devices connected to each other on a network, and all sharing information and relaying
data. This concept alone hints at the fact that there are multiple entryways for unauthorized users, as well as security concerns simply because
of the sheer number of interconnected devices. When it comes to homeowners who are using the IoT to power their smart home networks, how can
they minimize these IoT vulnerabilities? LetÕs take a look at some of the ways they can avert this:</p>

<h2 id="1-proper-password-management">1. Proper Password Management</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s always best, to begin with, the basics, and one of the basics of great network security is always making sure that you are properly
managing the passwords that grant devices access to your network. The first step to proper password management is to ensure that you create
unique passwords for each of the devices that you have connected to your smart home network. In addition to this, it is best to make sure that
you change these passwords on a regular basis so that you are consistently reducing the possibility of anyone discovering them. There are many
homeowners who overlook this simple method, but it goes a long way to help keep your network secure.</p>

<h2 id="2-utilize-a-secure-firewall">2. Utilize a secure Firewall</h2>

<p>It is important for homeowners to realize how vulnerable their networks can be if they do not provide any form of protection. One of the best
forms of protection comes in the form of a secure firewall. It is not a smart idea to leave your network protected by a simple router.
Homeowners should invest in secure firewalls that act as safeguards to every accessible endpoint that exists on their network. Firewalls exist
to help protect your network from unauthorized access and they greatly reduce the chances of anyone successfully <a href="/2016/10/19/is-your-security-camera-hacking-someone-else/">hacking into your smart home
network</a>.</p>

<h2 id="3-security-software-updates">3. Security Software Updates</h2>

<p>Managing software updates is quite similar to proper password management. This is because the brunt of the responsibility falls on the homeowner
to be attentive. It is important that you constantly check to see if there are software updates available for the devices that you have on your
smart home network. These software updates are an important part of ensuring that your devices continue to run smoothly.</p>

<p>In some cases, manufacturers might have discovered a flaw in the device and then release a software patch meant to rectify said problem. If the
user does not take advantage of these software patches, they will most likely end up having severe network flaws and holes that a hacker can
take advantage of to gain access to their network. One of the best ways to manage security software updates is to set at least 3 monthly
reminders. That way you never fall into the trap of forgetting that you need to update your security software.</p>

<h2 id="4-disable-additional-features">4. Disable additional features</h2>

<p>Now, this is something that many homeowners tend to overlook, simply because they do not know this might increase the chances of their network
being made vulnerable. In most cases, smart devices have additional features that grant them access to the networks at different times without
necessarily having to go through any security verification or authorization.</p>

<p>This process makes your entire network extremely vulnerable because it gives hackers the opportunity to exploit these loopholes. When you are
setting up your smart home network, it is imperative that you identify the additional features that each device might use. If there are any that
leave your network open and accessible, make sure that you disable these features. Essentially, you want to make it as hard as possible for a
hacker to gain access to your network. The most efficient way to do this is to plug up all possible access points that could end up being taken
advantage of.</p>

<h2 id="5-private-network">5. Private Network</h2>

<p>The Internet of Things is a network of interconnected devices. It is not really a shock that this might seem lucrative to hackers. However, an
additional way to minimize the flaws of an IoT network in the smart home is to utilize private networks. The use of a private network will add
an additional layer of security for your IoT devices. Also, it is always best to keep the network that functions with your IoT devices separate
from other networks so that they do not compromise each other with the amount of data that is being transmitted.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The IoT on a smart home network really changes the way a home can operate, and it increases the amount of possible things that any homeowner can
accomplish. The benefits of the IoT are very likely endless, as we are only just scratching the surface. However, there are some vulnerabilities
that exist, much like anything else, so it is crucial for homeowners to make sure that they are safe guarding themselves against any of these
vulnerabilities. You may think that this is a high level of paranoia, but it is important to remember that if someone is able to gain access to
one device on an IoT network, they will most likely gain access to your entire network simply by piggybacking off of the compromised device.</p>

<p>The steps mentioned above will help keep your smart home network safe, but do not forget that physical security also plays an important role in
stemming inherent network vulnerabilities. As a homeowner, make sure that you discuss your home security with a security professional or a
residential locksmith, they will be able to help you with <a href="http://united-locksmith.net/home-locksmith/smart-lock-installation">smart lock installations</a> as well as help you keep your home safe and secure.</p>
