      <guid>http://blog.sensr.net/2017/02/foscam-offline-why-cant-i-view-my-camera-live/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;width:50%&#34; src=&#34;http://blog.sensr.net/img/foscloud-failed-to-connect.png&#34; class=&#34;img-rounded&#34; alt=&#34;Foscam Cloud Connection Problems&#34;  &gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve setup two of the recent Foscam camera models, a Foscam FI9900P and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.sensr.net/2016/11/ftp-setup-on-the-foscam-wireless-security-camera-1920tvl/&#34;&gt;Foscam
1920TVL&lt;/a&gt;. Both support the Foscam cloud and the setup goes
pretty well. More on that another time. But frequently when I launch the &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/foscam/id924381688?mt=8&#34;&gt;Foscam iOS
app&lt;/a&gt; and the cameras are showing as offline when I know that they are
online. How do I know that? I&amp;rsquo;ve connected the cameras to Sensr.net and they continue to upload and show live on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sensr.net&#34;&gt;Sensr.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sensr.net/auth/users/sign_up&#34;&gt;
&lt;button style=&#34;background-color:#a4d61e;margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:16px;border-radius:4px;font-size:1.6em;padding:8px 20px;    font-family: &#34;GibsonSemibold&#34;, &#34;Helvetica Neue&#34;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;float:none !important;text-shadow:0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)&#34;&gt;
Sign up for free!
&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the issue here is that Foscam Cloud is a new service and it&amp;rsquo;s buggy. Maybe they aren&amp;rsquo;t keeping their servers up. Maybe
they aren&amp;rsquo;t monitoring their servers properly? Maybe the great firewall of China is blocking your camera from connecting to
servers over at Big Red. Building a cloud service and keeping it running can be complex, so I hope they are just having growing
pains and will get it sorted soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would you want to use the Foscam Cloud and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sensr.net&#34;&gt;Sensr.net&lt;/a&gt; together?  Sensr.net is a pretty simple
DVR in the cloud.  We have lots of cool features but the one thing we can&amp;rsquo;t support is the pan/tilt/zoom that you get
in the Foscam app.  Our service is built on having the cameras upload directly to the Sensr.net servers.  This simiplifies
setup and means you &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.sensr.net/2013/10/24/ip-camera-no-firewall-config/&#34;&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t need any difficult firewall port forwarding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
But it also means we can&amp;rsquo;t support PTZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We do support live streams though, so if you&amp;rsquo;re running into the &lt;em&gt;Failed to connect&lt;/em&gt; issue and can&amp;rsquo;t see your camera, try setting up your camera on Sensr.net and viewing the live view through us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sensr.net/auth/users/sign_up&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have a free trial so you have nothing to loose!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would love to hear your experience with Focam Cloud or Sensr.net, so please leave us a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.sensr.net/img/zombie-ip-camera.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Never give up!&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ok, these &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Hikvision-DS-2CD2042WD-I-Network-English-Security/dp/B01DIKF4XG/sensr-20&#34;&gt;Hikvision cameras&lt;/a&gt; are pretty nice
and seem like great quality for the price.  However, I have one major issue with them, they
don&amp;rsquo;t let you use hostnames for the FTP server.  You have to use an IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure &gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Hikvision-DS-2CD2042WD-I-Network-English-Security/dp/B01DIKF4XG/sensr-20&#34;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.sensr.net/img/DS-2CD2042WD-I.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Hikvision DS-2CD2042WD-I Bullet Camera&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.sensr.net/img/hikvision-ftp-setup.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Hikvision FTP Setup&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why would they require this?  I suppose for most cameras connect to a server on the local network, thus it won&amp;rsquo;t have a DNS name
anyway, why not just require an IP address? It means that when the camera does connect to the FTP server, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to do
a DNS lookup, but that seems like a pretty big trade off. You have to hardwire the IP address into the camera config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-external-servers&#34;&gt;What about external servers?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you require an IP address, then you need to find the IP address of the server. At &lt;a href=&#34;https://sensr.net&#34;&gt;Sensr.net&lt;/a&gt; we run FTP servers and we
use hostnames like &lt;code&gt;f0.sensr.net&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to use the Hikvision with our service, you need to connect to one of our servers (currently f0 through f9).
But to use the Hikvision, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to find out the IP address of our servers.  In the case of &lt;code&gt;f9.sensr.net&lt;/code&gt; you can run &lt;code&gt;nslookup&lt;/code&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ nslookup f9.sensr.net
Server:		8.8.8.8
Address:	8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	f9.sensr.net
Address: 74.207.245.42
Name:	f9.sensr.net
Address: 96.126.101.33
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, notice that it returns two different answers.  At Sensr.net we (currently) have two servers that serve as &lt;code&gt;f9.sensr.net&lt;/code&gt;.  We do this
for redundancy.  If one of our servers fails, then the other one can take over for it.  Of course this redundancy won&amp;rsquo;t help you
if you hard wire the IP address.  For the Hikvision, just pick one or the other IP addresses and it should work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-loadbalancing-and-failover&#34;&gt;What about loadbalancing and failover?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of screws up our load balancing and failover.  But at least it works.  However, it only works as long as our servers keep the same IP
address.  What if we upgrade or move a server?  It&amp;rsquo;s IP address will change and your camera won&amp;rsquo;t work anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;maybe-security-could-be-compromised-too&#34;&gt;Maybe security could be compromised too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use servers at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linode.com&#34;&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt; and we might decide to upgrade and get a bigger server at Linode,
or maybe move to &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com&#34;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. In that case,
the IP address that we used to use will get deprecated.  This probably means your camera will stop working.  But it could mean that it starts
uploading to a server that isn&amp;rsquo;t part of Sensr.net!  Let&amp;rsquo;s say we drop the server at Linode, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty likely that Linode will re-use that IP
address for someone else.  That new owner might notice that there are cameras trying to connect to it.  That new owner might also decide to let
those cameras connect and then they could start collecting images that are uploaded by your cameras.  Hmm, that seems like a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-serious-is-this&#34;&gt;How serious is this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we have changed the IP addresses of our upload servers once in 6 years.  So it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen often.  However, we are working on a
major change and I expect the IP addresses will change in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-we-do-to-help&#34;&gt;What can we do to help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we change servers and drop the IP addresses for these machines,
we can move over the DNS names (&lt;code&gt;f0.sensr.net .. f9.sensr.net&lt;/code&gt;) and see what cameras continue to connect. If all the cameras move over (they won&amp;rsquo;t)
then we don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will be cameras left connecting to the old IP addresses.  In this case we can warn our users that they need
to update their cameras.  We&amp;rsquo;ll probably send out an email and give our users some time to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;zombie-cameras&#34;&gt;Zombie cameras&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://blog.sensr.net/img/zombiecam.png&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Never give up!&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have quite a few zombie cameras trying to connect to our servers.  Zombies are cameras that used to work with the service, but no longer
are on paid accounts.  This means we don&amp;rsquo;t let them upload images, their logins fail.  But most zombies keep plugging away,  mindlessly attempting
to upload to our servers even though we won&amp;rsquo;t let them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of these cameras, we may not be able to contact the owners, so after we finally decomission the servers, they may end up connecting to
some new server deployed at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linode.com&#34;&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt;. If the owner of that new server decides to let the zombie connect, they could end up collecting
lots of potentially private images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iot-gone-mad&#34;&gt;IoT gone mad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one example of how the IoT world is leading to unintended consequences.  People setup cameras so they can be more secure, but
through a sequence of perfectly normal events they end up with something they don&amp;rsquo;t expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll ask Linode if they will decommission those IP addresses.  Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll just keep paying for them.  One thing is for sure, we will
warn users before we release the IP addresses back into the pool.  We&amp;rsquo;ll keep track of how much upload traffic we get to our deprecated
servers.  It might lead to another interesting blog post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned, the Zombie Apocalypse is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shameless-plug&#34;&gt;Shameless plug&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re still not afraid of the zombies, we would love to have you as a customer. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sensr.net/auth/users/sign_up&#34;&gt;Point your IP camera at us&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;rsquo;ll do some useful stuff with what you send us. We have a free trial, so it won&amp;rsquo;t cost you anything.  If you decide not to stick with us, please
delete our FTP server from your camera. It will be as satisfying as shooting a zombie in the head!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
