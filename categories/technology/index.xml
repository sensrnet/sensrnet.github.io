      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Dans les entrailles urbaines / In the urban bowels&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/m43photos/12239139316/in/photolist-jDwMHo-cxs18J-fAiNqu-dgqBrp-8JiYae-zJCUs-5hmBet-ciyJEf-aqSgjf-4zhcab-e6MK4D-3dqLhP-qP2FY-9u9Vmd-aqrFT2-6F34w2-5NAo8e-5M2nnt-cxt85q-2zrJy9-7aUP9A-5NEEK7-deB66G-bEtv1q-dksYJC-c7gy4E-rU8r9v-5S8j7P-bToeAP-6F7cKq-5NEEMf-6F7d5b-dNifDu-3bsbWr-6F7cUA-5NAoan-5NEEfh-ckh731-5NAod6-sNL1k-8DkNxR-skKu3-sGNzi-8B9Dfe-4Poqgd-cv5hA5-cvgpHu-iH8cKJ-jSg8jZ-dgSE9g&#34; data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5524/12239139316_6e97104ce8_k.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dans les entrailles urbaines / In the urban bowels&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;334&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IoT (Internet of Things) is taking off. We&amp;rsquo;re coming up with all kinds of internet connected devices. Many of these devices are simply computers with interesting sensors and controllers attached. At Sensr.net we think mostly about IP cameras, which are a specific kind of IoT device. But that &lt;a href=&#34;https://nest.com/thermostat/meet-nest-thermostat/&#34; title=&#34;Nest Thermostat&#34;&gt;Nest thermostat&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E&#34; title=&#34;Amazon Echo&#34;&gt;Amazon Echo speaker&lt;/a&gt; are also examples of IoT devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days most IP cameras will connect to your internet via WiFi or Ethernet and allow you to view and control the camera remotely. Many of these cameras include a P2P (peer to peer) feature that allows you to view the camera directly even if you don&amp;rsquo;t open your firewall. This is a neat trick which is accomplished by having the camera keep open a connection back to some well known server. When you want to connect to your camera, you&amp;rsquo;re really connecting to some remote server (in China maybe?) that then does some network magic (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN&#34; title=&#34;STUN: Session Traversal Utilities for NAT&#34;&gt;STUN&lt;/a&gt;) and lets your smartphone app connect to your camera through your firewall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That nice P2P feature is pretty great, but it also means that there are servers out there on the net that can get inside your home network. Where are those servers running? Who&amp;rsquo;s job is it to make sure they are secure? Who has access to those servers and thus your network and even your cameras?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-your-cams-are-belong-to-us&#34;&gt;All your cams are belong to us&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Mostly we&amp;rsquo;re pretty cavalier about connecting cool new gadgets to our networks. Maybe we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. It seems like there ought to be some way to make sure the devices you trust are actually trustworthy. How can we be sure that our security cameras are actually secure? (Warning: &lt;a href=&#34;http://sensr.net/blog/2016/10/19/is-your-security-camera-hacking-someone-else/&#34; title=&#34;Cameras hacked into botnets&#34;&gt;They probably aren&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;truthiness-in-our-firmware&#34;&gt;Truthiness in our firmware?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these devices run an operating system of some kind embedded down in their firmware. What if we created an open source firmware that we could trust? We could buy fun cheap hardware from our friends in China but then install our own good old open source code on that hardware instead of trusting the glop that came on it. Don&amp;rsquo;t want your camera connecting out some potentially compromised P2P jumphost somewhere? No problem! Just install your own firmware and configure your own jumphost or maybe one run by a company you trust. (This could be a new business opportunity for &lt;a href=&#34;https://sensr.net&#34; title=&#34;Sensr.net: Watch your stuff!&#34;&gt;Sensr.net&lt;/a&gt; maybe&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-say-tomato-6-8230&#34;&gt;You say &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_(firmware)&#34; title=&#34;Tomato Firmware&#34;&gt;tomato&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one successful example of this, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index&#34; title=&#34;DD-WRT Site&#34;&gt;DD-WRT software&lt;/a&gt; that runs on a large number of routers.  There are a bunch of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_router_firmware_projects&#34; title=&#34;Router Firmware&#34;&gt;open source firmwares&lt;/a&gt; out there. Why can&amp;rsquo;t we have one for cameras? Or more generally IoT devices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-together-now&#34;&gt;All together now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in joining an effort along these lines, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@sensr.net?Subject=Open%20firmware&#34; target=&#34;_top&#34;&gt;drop me an email&lt;/a&gt; or contribute to the project on Github: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sensrnet/sensros&#34; title=&#34;SensrOS: Open source IP Camera Firmware&#34;&gt;https://github.com/sensrnet/sensros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of cool things that could be built into this firmware.  Imagine the machine learning projects or advanced image recognition that could be built into something like this. More basic things could be done too, like reference designs for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.onvif.org/&#34; title=&#34;ONVIF&#34;&gt;ONVIF&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psialliance.org/&#34; title=&#34;Physical Security Interoperability Alliance&#34;&gt;PSIA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is your security camera hacking someone else?</title>

      <description>&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_3207&#34; style=&#34;width: 768px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-3207&#34; src=&#34;http://blog.sensr.net/img/2016/10/wsjscreenshot-1024x5741.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Who watches the watchers?&#34; width=&#34;758&#34; height=&#34;562&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px&#34; /&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Who watches the watchers?
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month the Wall Street Journal reported: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-infect-army-of-cameras-dvrs-for-massive-internet-attacks-1475179428&#34;&gt;Hackers Infect Army of Cameras, DVRs for Massive Internet Attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can something like this happen?  It turns out security cameras and DVRs are just network connected computers, and they can be hacked just like any other computer.  However, it&amp;#8217;s worse than that, a large number of these systems ship with default passwords, so anyone who can connect to them can get into the system and install any software they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-my-firewall&#34;&gt;What about my firewall?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, what does it matter that there are default passwords on these systems?  These devices are normally behind a firewall, right?  Maybe, but most DVRs and IP cameras are configured so you can view and configure them from outside your firewall.  When these systems are installed, most of them instruct you to set up port forwarding.  This is where you can get into trouble.  If you configure your firewall for port forwarding, you&amp;#8217;re allowing anyone on the internet to connect to your device.  If you setup port forwarding but don&amp;#8217;t bother to change the default passwords, then you&amp;#8217;re asking for trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-are-your-own-it-guy&#34;&gt;You are your own IT guy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do setup port forwarding, make sure you change all the default passwords and keep your firmware up to date.  Yes, this is a hassle.  Updating firmware on wireless security cameras is error prone and confusing.  You have to make sure you have the right firmware for your camera.  Sometimes there are slightly different hardware versions and if you install the wrong firmware on the wrong hardware, you&amp;#8217;ll brick your device.  Another hassle is that most manufacturers insist that you do the upgrade over a wired connection.  This sounds easy until you realize that the camera is mounted somewhere and now you have to get your toolbox and a ladder just to upgrade your firmware.  No wonder these devices are not getting updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;can-sensr-net-help&#34;&gt;Can Sensr.net help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, using &lt;a href=&#34;https://sensr.net&#34; title=&#34;Sensr.net: Watch your stuff &#34;&gt;Sensr.net&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t require port forwarding (cameras push to our servers, nothing reaches back into your network).  This means if you&amp;#8217;re using security cameras or network attached DVRs don&amp;#8217;t need to be accessible from the internet at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;try-sensr-net-for-free&#34;&gt;Try Sensr.net for free&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;]&lt;a href=&#34;http://flic.kr/p/4TqrbZ&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://sensr.net&#34;&gt;Sensr.net we provide a cloud service for recording your webcam or IP camera&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately these cameras sometimes get stolen. Recently we had a user who&amp;#8217;s home was burgalrized and the theif had the gall to steal his Sensr.net connected camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that he also decided to setup the camera for himself, so he took the camera home, after a stop at Taco Bell for some refreshments, and plugged it into his home router. The faithful Foscam jumped on the thief&amp;#8217;s network and continued uploading to Sensr.net. We have some great shots of the thief, along with the remnants of his fast food meal, and even a shot of the bottom of his router.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our user contacted us to see if we could provide the IP address used by the camera while it was uploading to our service. Sure enough, our analytics keeps track of that, so now the police have some pretty good pointers to our bad guy. No news on his capture as of yet, but it&amp;#8217;s pretty gratifying nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sensr.net&#34;&gt;Sensr.net works with pretty much any off the shelf webacam or IP camera.&lt;/a&gt; We simply capture JPEG images uploaded to us via FTP or HTTP. We do motion detection on our side and transform those uploads to live video streams as well as archives. We do a lot more than this, so check out Sensr.net if you&amp;#8217;re interested in learning more. We have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://sensr.net/auth/users/sign_up&#34;&gt;one week free trial, so give it a try&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our friend Bob Coggeshall wrote a nice post on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sudobob.com/raspberry-pi-web-cam-on-sensr-net/&#34;&gt;how to use a webcam and a Raspberry Pi to create a Sensr.net backed security camera&lt;/a&gt;. Who doesn&amp;#8217;t have an old webcam laying around?  Now you can put it to good use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Bob!&lt;/p&gt;
